# gmlunesa.github.io

This is my personal website, featuring a mauve color scheme, built from scratch. It features a small portfolio of my projects and a little something about me. It is fully mobile responsive.

I still plan to put some js stuff in my website in the near future. Please stay tuned~ I also have another [version](https://github.com/gmlunesa/personal-website) of this repository, but with NodeJS framework.
